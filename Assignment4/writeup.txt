Please answer the following questions and submit them along with your source
files for the assignment.

1. What specific words did you use to test your syllable-counting code? Why
   did you choose each of those words as test cases?


2. What specific strings did you use to test your tokenize method? Why did you
   choose those strings?
   
   
3. What specific strings did you use to test your code for counting syllables,
   words, and sentences in a line of text? Why did you choose those strings?
   
   
4. Find a piece of text of your own choosing and compute its Flesch-Kincaid
   grade level and Dale-Chall readability scores using the program you've
   written. What numbers did you get back? Were you at all surprised? (We
   recommend trying out your program on some text from one of your favorite
   books; say, one of the Harry Potter titles, Fifty Shades of Grey, or perhaps
   Karel the Robot Learns Java. Project Gutenberg, located online at
   http://www.gutenberg.org/, might be a good place to look for older books now
   in the public domain.)
